# Bets.Local

This project is made to organize bets without any real money for your local matches. First of all its made for our local tournaments,  so it has its own characteristics.

## Seasons

Everything starts with season. Initially you have no balance. Once you created season - balance for this season appears for each user. Every "match" is attached to season. The user's primary goal is to gain as many points as possible during the season. So you have leaderboard with per season filtering.
